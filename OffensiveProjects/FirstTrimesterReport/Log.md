What follows is an account of the process of completing this project from start to finish. 
This is for future generations of the Football NinerStats team to look back on and learn from as well as use as a guideline.

(MAIN) DATA GATHERING AND CLEANING PROCESS:

The first step of any good project in analytics is getting your data together and looking neat.
To do this I needed to gather my data from two sources, from PFF(Pro Football Focus) and from our in-house system in the front office (Catapult).

  (SUB) GATHERING DATA FROM PFF:
  
  First, you need to log into your PFF Ultimate account. Your login is not your own, but rather from a member of the coaching staff or a team lead (offense or defense). Be sure to ask them for it if you need to       grab data.
  Next, you will come to the starting page of the PFF system. From here you will want to filter the available plays to your needs. (Filtering access underscored in red)

  Once you click on "Filters" you can see you can get very specific with how you filter the data available.

  For the purposes of this project, we will show a relatively basic filtering process in order to access offensive data.

  To access data for Charlotte Football and only Charlotte Football, keep "League" set to "NCAA". Then for "Season/Weeks" filter to the specific season you are working in and select the weeks you need to         include.     An example of the first trimester of the 2023 season is shown below.

Once the data was gathered came the challenge of cleaning the data...
